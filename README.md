Hello! I’m @anna-ringwood, a public policy and data analytics graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I aspire to use my data skills to help underserved populations in areas like K-12 education, mental health, and housing. My undergraduate education at Emory University first sparked my interest in data science for social good, and the projects I completed both there and at CMU can be found in this repository. I also hope to add some of my own personal projects here in the near future. Thanks for stopping by! 🐳 🐳 🐳
